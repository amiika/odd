# Odd Tutorials

Esoteric creative coding tutorial, written and documented in literal programming style using Markdown. Each section also includes single HTML-application referencing external AudioWorkletProcessor or WebGl script.

Tutorials are written using Github style Mardown and parsed using marked.js to support custom widgets that inserted when accessing the tutorial from [Github pages](add link here).

# AI disclaimer

I have used AI to learn, code and debug these pointless gimmicks. It has taken a long time to make all of this, so a lot of time and resources were wasted in the process.

# Contributing

Why not? Just shoot with a new odd section that explains things and follows the design pattern.
